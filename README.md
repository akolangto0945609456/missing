# Alliance Software OJT Tools by Master Sanchez

Hey there! 👋 This is a collection of easy-to-use tools I created during my OJT at **Alliance Software** to make daily tasks faster, smoother, and way more convenient. If you work with sales data, SQL, or XML files, these little helpers might just save you some serious time.

## What’s Inside?

### 🕵️ Missing Receipt Finder / Checker  
Upload your sales transaction files, and it’ll find any missing Official Receipt (OR) numbers for you. It even spits out ready-to-use SQL scripts so you can update your database in a snap. No more manual hunting — just fast, efficient results.

### 🗑️ Delete Frecno Tool  
Got some `frecno` values you want gone? Just enter them here, and this tool will generate the perfect SQL DELETE commands. Clean up your database easily and safely.

### 🆕 Generate New Frecno  
Forget about the headache of incrementing `frecno` values manually. Enter the latest number, and it’ll generate a neat list with SQL commands to keep your database in tip-top shape.

### 📄 XML Checker  
Doing accreditation? This one’s for you. It renames XML files and updates tenant IDs and keys inside automatically — making the whole process quick and painless.

### 🔧 FlashLogs (Coming Soon!)  
Still cooking this one! It’s a batch file to grab your local `iportfolio.log` and XML files for easier log handling and troubleshooting.

## Why I Made These

During my OJT at Alliance Software, I saw a lot of repetitive, time-consuming work that could be automated. So I built these tools to help myself—and hopefully others—work smarter, not harder. They’re designed to be straightforward and get the job done without fuss.

Simple, right?
